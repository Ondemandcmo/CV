        <p>I’m on a mission to make marketing simple for small business owners.
          I love nerding out on consumer behavior, new marketing technology, and marketing fundamentals; It’s an oldie and a goodie.
          The most exciting game is figuring out how and why people make choices. I have a confession, but you have to lean in so no one can hear me.
          Me:(whispers) “one of my favorite past times is people watching. It’s like getting a front-row seat to the best marketing reality TV show in the world.”
          What would we call the show? Keeping Up with the average folks?
          I don’t love the name; I welcome your suggestions. haha
          In high school, I was the kid that would watch my friends and try to predict what they’d do next or how they would respond to something I said.
          Yup, at 16, I knew marketing was my passion.
          Marketing is becoming more complex and is taking more time to do, but it’s not like small business owners are magically getting more time.
          I know what it’s like to be good at “the thing,” but have your competition get customers because they are better at marketing.
